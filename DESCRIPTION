Description: Shiny is a great package. Yet, for more complex
             projects, I find it hard to write clean code with
             its reactivity paradigm. This package wraps shiny
             into a more traditional ui programming approach:
             - event handlers for input changes and button clicks
             - explicit update functions to change outputs
