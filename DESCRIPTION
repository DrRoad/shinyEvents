Title: Shiny wrapper with event handlers instead of reactivity
Version: 0.1.1

Description: Shiny is a great package. Yet, for more complex
    projects, with much dynamic UI, I find it hard
    to write clean code with its reactivity paradigm.
    This package wraps shiny into a more traditional
    programming approach:
    - event handlers for input changes and button clicks
    - explicit update functions to change outputs
    - no explicit server function
